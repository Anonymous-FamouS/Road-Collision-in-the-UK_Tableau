# 🚗💥🚕 Road-Collision-in-the-UK_Tableau
This project visualises road collisions in the UK between 2019 and 2020 using an interactive dashboard built in Tableau Desktop and published to [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RoadCollisionDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
The project and the files were adapted from this [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhv_HPjtTyU&list=PLO9LeSU_vHCU_DHaLzEvsLxFdmB3Qcao_&index=19) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n5JKmnSpbA&list=PLO9LeSU_vHCU_DHaLzEvsLxFdmB3Qcao_&index=20).




The dashboard enables users to explore trends, spatial distributions, and contributing factors behind road traffic accidents, providing insight into:

Collision counts by severity and year
Regional differences across UK authorities
Casualty types (e.g. pedestrian, cyclist, car occupant)
Weather and road condition impacts
Time and day-of-week distributions
📊 Final Outcome
